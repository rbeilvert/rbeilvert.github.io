                <h2>Designed over the structure of a dead upright piano</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to lighten the structure and make some room for the incoming electronics, all the mechanics from the piano has been removed and every string has been cut in deafning apocalyptical dissonant chords. Don't forget to put on strong gloves and glasses if you do that, there really is a lot of tension in these !<br/>
                    After that, we jigsawed out rectangles from the front panel of the piano to place the LCD screens and refreshed that old piano with some fancy paint.

                <p>
                    To prevent the screens from any kind of assault from ENSEEIHT <em>energetic</em> students, we mounted two half-centimeter polycarbonate bulletproof panes on the screen frames. Well... Good prevention is better than cure, don't you think ?

                <p>
                    The LCD screens used for this project came from two similar dead laptops. At this time, we did not have the interface boards to use them with HDMI cables, but those were on their way, ordered on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/M-NT68676-2A-HDMI-DVI-VGA-Audio-LCD-LED-Screen-Controller-Board-Diy-Monitor-Kit-/110977522562?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19d6c69b82" target="_new">Ebay</a> for $40 each. <br/>
                    To give a name to the arcade station, Maxime cut out these awesome <em>ARCADE 7</em> letters according to the <em>Captain America</em> font. Why <em>ARCADE 7</em> ? Because at ENSEEIHT, we put sevens everywhere. Actually, in French, the school name can be pronounced <em>n' set</em>, and phonetically, <em>set</em> means... <em>7</em>. Hum... Anyway, this is no big deal.
